### Hello, friend ðŸ‘‹

My nameâ€™s Alexander Seifert, and Iâ€™m a product-minded NLP engineer with a background in computer science, linguistics, and philosophy. Iâ€™m the NLP team lead at Apollo.ai and currently enrolled in the Artificial Intelligence Professional Program at Stanford. On the side, I co-run a small, family-owned, independent book publishing company, aptly called Seifert Verlag.

My interests are rather broad, but Iâ€™m most passionate about technology, business, music, and the human condition. This blog is predominantly about Natural Language Processing and related areas, although I have also done some longer-form writings about philosophy in the past that I still think are interesting.

Iâ€™m happy to hear from you, so if you want to reach out, please do so through any of the following channels:
